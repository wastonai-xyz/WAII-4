1. Data Quality Improvement
Key Idea: Instead of solely scaling model size or computational resources, enhancing data quality can yield comparable or superior performance gains.
Illustration: A comparison chart showing the performance improvements from model scaling versus data quality enhancement.
2. Introduction to WAAI-4
Specifications: WAAI-4 is a 14-billion parameter model.
Advancements: Incorporates new synthetic data generation methods and optimizations in training procedures.
Illustration: A diagram showing the WAAI-4 model structure and its main components.
3. Synthetic Data
Generation Methods:
Multi-agent prompting: Using multiple agents to generate questions and answers.
Self-revision workflows: The model improves its own outputs through self-revision.
Instruction reversal: Reversing instructions to create new data.
Illustration: A flowchart displaying the synthetic data generation process with the three techniques.
4. Post-Training Optimization
Techniques:
Rejection sampling: Filtering out suboptimal outputs to refine results.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO): Enhancing output quality based on direct preference criteria.
Illustration: A diagram of the post-training process, highlighting how rejection sampling and DPO are applied.
